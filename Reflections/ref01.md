# Reflection 1 in Module 1

- What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?
  Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.

I did already put my string of thoughts into the module notes, but repetition is the source of knowledge. So take-aways are about the teaching philosophy, what the mentality is approaching teaching. So this guides the techniques to be used, such as ungrading. This "ungrading" is one idea that stuck with me throughout, especially the notion, that grading dampens the effort students are giving. Besides ungrading, challenge-based education is an interesting notion to further deepen motivation. With my experience from supervision other seminars, although students with their own projects/challenges can be really motivated to work on them, these examples turn out to be a bit rare, and generally we still depend on us as teachers to provide the projects. So I am interested in seeing how we are pushed in the IoT course to think of our own challenges.
  
- What was good?

The interactivity with students. The engagement, so that it is not a straight-on lecture. For this, I have to commend the team and Ulrich, as their style suits this open classroom, open discussion. The wand demo was well-executed and interesting - especially the fact that some of the student's got to themselves try the spells. Again - breaking the ice and fostering interactivity. Overall, a good practical.

- What was difficult, where did you struggle?

The second part of the practical was a bit ambitious, and with technical mishaps. To allow for live troubleshooting of the workshop, we were given the architecture exercise. However, I felt a bit rushed with the architecture exercise. While making the definitions clear (and writing them out for myself), at the same time I was also trying to connect to the IoT-Empower Node-RED (and had this weird DNS issue). This parallelization meant I quickly ran out of time for the intended educational task. I do acknowledge, that since this Node-RED was successfully ran on my neighbor's machine, I could have just conceded the point and focused fully on the architecture task, avoiding losing out on learning more about these concepts. So, if I had the chance to turn back time, then that would be something I would do different.

Another, is getting acquainted with Node-RED. Even though with our partner, once we got access to Node-RED, then it started moving faster. However, if we missed the explanation from Ulrich, then it was a bit hard to catch up again on the task to be done. The interface is new, and the blocks and their functionalities are new. This hopefully will get better as we get more familiar, but at this point in time, was a bit foreign - for instance, figuring out the "MQTT in - switch - replace - MQTT out" chain for making a console print after pressing the button.

- Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?
  Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

Overall, it was a lot of fun. The slight chaos, even though noticeably stressful for the instructors, is for me a part of the reality. Normalizing that sometimes the things we do just fall apart, embracing this chaos and unpredictability, and making that into a learning experience is valuable. So some chaos is fine, as long as you don't get too visibly worked up or excessively apologetic about it.

Sending your neighbors messages to their M5Sticks was a lot of fun. I unfortunately forgot to take a picture of that, but we were sending messages "HACKED by group 06", and got some amused reactions out of it.

There definitely was some struggling, but not maybe the good kind. To clarify myself, for me struggling can be cleanly separated into two: 1) the fun, developing, educative struggling ("aah, this is an interesting and hard problem, I just need to wrap my head around to solve it"), or 2) frustrating, running your head against the wall, nearly meaningless, struggling ("the nodered website doesn't load for me, but loads for the partner"). Both types of struggling were seen today, however at times I felt we were stuck very long in the frustrating struggling (the nodered servers, the passwords, etc), and due to that had to rush the fun and educative struggling (I would have loved to spend more time figuring out the nodes myself).

And on a similar topic, this exploration could have been further supported, if all of the students individually could have connected to the Node-RED. At times, I felt as more of a passenger to my groupmate solving the tasks - I would have wanted to take some things at my own pace and in my own way.

- How was your interaction with peers/instructors?

Overall good. I knew my neighbor, I know the instructors. Maybe everyone gravitated towards already people they know, so groups formed naturally, but I am hoping to break the ice further with also my other peers.

- Help and extra work
  - Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?
  My neighbor, Reo, helped me with trying to solve my issue connecting with Node-RED. 

  - Who did you help, gave feedback to?
  Since me and Reo were among the first ones to get the stuff running, the TAs just came to ask to be sure on some of the details, such as what is the correct MQTT topic.

  - Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?
  No.
