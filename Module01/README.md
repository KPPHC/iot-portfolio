# Module 1




In this module we are introduced to the IoT course, the team behind it, and a little bit about what is IoT itself. Definitely a highlight is the teaching philosophy behind the IoT course, involving of course some techniques (open-concept classroom, ungrading), but also the overall mentality guiding these techniques - we are here to learn and teach, not for giving grades or passing exams. One of the most difficult tasks (thus far into the day) has been thinking of a challenge, that we would like to overcome - there are ideas that I can bring from my own PhD projects, that are in dire need of additional help.

## Task Inspirations

- The mentality behind teaching guides what techniques to use. Who or what is a teacher? What is the goal?
- To be filled in later in more detail (if I don't forget), but excellence in implementation, derived from repeated cycles of trial-failure-reflection.

## Task Personal Profile

## Task What is IoT

Domains and included areas:

- Wearables - my own homefield
- Smart cities
- Environmental monitoring


Commonly used (data) protocols:

- MQTT - "the most important", lightweight, operating on pub/sub, where clients sub to a topic pub'd by the server
- WebSocket - I have used this before, but might not be the most suitable for IoT, as requiring a browser is a bit heavy. Ulno here said more about HTTP as the second most common.

Typical devices (appliance or micro controller):

- Raspberry Pi
- M5Stick

Challenges:

- Improving SEASHELL - how to fit multi-spectral light sensing on a smart-ring form factor?
- Potential improvements for SWAN? Additional modalities can be one, integrating them together, but this is a bit leaning too much into data processing and analysis. I believe there has to be a more attractive, and concrete, angle for improving SWAN. More thoughts needed.
