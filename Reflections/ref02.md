# Reflection 2 in Module 2

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?


I did already put my string of thoughts into the module notes, but repetition is the source of knowledge. For this part, I felt getting your hands dirty and doing it yourself taught a lot. After the practical session me and my groupmates met again, and we did the things at our own pace, and that really helped us get it together.

## What was good?

Yes, it was good. The workbook is sufficiently detailed, the tasks interesting. 

## What was difficult, where did you struggle?

The pull-up resistor and pull-down resistor points I was not getting that well from the workbook nor the slides - those came from the interactions with the instructors. Secondly, Task 4 was a bit of a struggle to get done - even though a hand-drawn schematic would suffice, I really want to get it done on Fritzing. At the time of this writing, I really have not got Fritzing yet, so will do that as time goes on. 

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration? Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

Overall, no issues. Getting the relay to make sounds and the solenoid lock to work was fun. There are some issues I have on my end to upload to my microcontroller, but since it worked for my partner, then I didn't start troubleshooting that yet - TODO!

## How was your interaction with peers/instructors?

Overall good. At first it was a bit of a slow start, but as we started getting familiar with my partner, I felt we found a common language. Looking forward to ongoing collaboration!

## Help and extra work
  - Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?
    
  Haris helped me a lot during the course, Leopold pointed out some extra stuff regarding the ports! Later on, when me and my partner Leopold met, Arthur also came to study with us and gave some good troubleshooting tips for our tasks.

  - Who did you help, gave feedback to?
    
  I helped my partner, Leopold, conceptualize some of the stuff.

  - Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?
    
  No.
